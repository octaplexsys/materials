os.PathError$InvalidSegment: [Github/blog] is not a valid path segment.
[/] is not a valid character to appear in a path segment. If you want to parse
an absolute or relative path that may have multiple segments, e.g. path-strings
coming from external sources use the Path(...) or RelPath(...) constructor calls
to convert them.
